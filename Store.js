But now, Copilot will do far more than those two earlier offerings could even conceive of, and the power of the result, both inside and outside of Microsoft, is incredible.Before the event, I met with a company called Reply, which specializes in getting companies ready for Copilot and setting up metrics so that they can confirm the benefits of the technology.

After all, what legitimate counter argument is there to the assertions that “all lives are equal” and “freedom is a human right”? What makes this outcome predictable is that the type of athlete activism attempted by Khawaja has never found a welcoming home in his sport.It’s been 60 years since CLR James asked, “What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?” It was a prompt to fans and players to interrogate the game’s colonial legacy, to challenge existing racial inequities, and to recognise that forces beyond the boundary determined who had the privilege of scoring runs and taking wickets for their country.

He might be working with a massive budget now, but the man stays true to his roots and sticking with what he knows pays off.The pacing may seem disjointed or fragmented at times, but I feel that only reflects the complex nature of the multiverse within the film.

While many held out hope for even a brief reprisal of his role, it appears that won’t be the case. Only time will reveal the authenticity of these claims, leaving fans disheartened by this development.As some had speculated, Sam and Bucky’s journey began in Captain America: Civil War, establishing a bond very distinct and unique from Bucky’s connection with Steve Rogers. This could justify Sebastian Stan’s limited role in the latest Captain America sequel which would predominantly focus on Sam Wilson.Yet, reports suggest Bucky’s significance grows in the upcoming Thunderbolts, signaling his resurgence into a prominent role within the latest phases of the MCU yet again, giving some much-needed closure to the fans.",

A McDonald’s All-American, Montross was a true 7-footer during his senior year of high school at Lawrence North in Indianapolis. Averaging over 20 points per game, and setting a school record in rebounds (which stands to this day), there was plenty of attention when it came time for recruiting.The assumption was that Montross would follow in his family’s footsteps. Both his father and grandfather played for Michigan, and the Wolverines were one of the top teams when it came time to commit. Instead, Montross decided to walk his own path — joining the Tar Heels where he would become a legend."

Your triceps contains three different “heads”; a short head, a medial head, and a long head— each with different attachment sites Your triceps accelerate elbow extension (straightening your arm at the elbow) and shoulder extension (moving your arm toward your backside— the exact opposite of shoulder flexion)."

The types of muscle fibers targeted in different types of training programs can impact sports performance training goals. Skeletal muscles are made up of individual muscle fibers. And like muscles themselves, not all muscle fibers are the same. There are two types of skeletal muscle fibers, fast-twitch and slow-twitch, and they each have different functions that are important to understand when it comes to movement and exercise programming. Slow-twitch muscle fibers are fatigue resistant, and focused on sustained, smaller movements and postural control. They contain more mitochondria and myoglobin, and are aerobic in nature compared to fast-twitch fibers. Slow-twitch fibers are also sometimes called type I or red fibers because of their blood supply.  "

This is an outcome of enhanced caloric expenditure, increased lean body mass, greater fat utilization and overall weight loss.Our resting metabolic rate (RMR) plays a significant role in this, and it’s understandable why it garners so much attention. But before we dive into RMR, let’s take a look at the components of total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)."

Let's explore the three body types more in depth - endomorph, mesomorph, and ectomorph - and analyze how they relate to overall body composition.Body type, or somatotype, refers to the idea that there are three generalized body compositions that people are predetermined to have. The concept was theorized by Dr. W.H. Sheldon back in the early 1940s, naming the three somatotypes endomorph, mesomorph, and ectomorph. It was originally believed that a person’s somatotype was unchangeable, and that certain physiological and psychological characteristics were even determined by whichever one a person aligns to."

                description: "Cisco announced this morning that it intends to acquire Isovalent, a cloud-native security and networking startup that should fit well with the company’s core networking and security strategy. The companies did not share the purchase price.Isovalent has helped develop eBPF, a key open source technology that gives developers deep insight into the operating system layer, typically Linux, but also Windows, while Cilium, another open source project created by the startup, gives visibility into cloud native applications. Tetragon is the company’s open source security visibility component.Tom Gillis, senior VP and general manager of Cisco’s Security Business Group says the combination of these three elements used to be provided by a hardware appliance, but in the cloud world is increasingly software-driven. “In a cloud world, there’s still boxes in there somewhere, but it’s abstracted under layers and layers of software. And so eBPF and Cilium provide that visibility for cloud world,” he told TechCrunch."

                description: "A woman in a blue tracksuit is on the floor of a bright asylum-like room, stretching in a pigeon yoga pose when she turns to the stranger she plans to live with for 100 days “What are you going to do with this money?” she asks. The two contestants in MrBeast’s newest video, Suzie Taylor and Bailey Stanfield, have been cohabitating for nearly three weeks at this point, isolated from the rest of the world. They only eat canned food, and all they have to entertain themselves is a deck of cards that they made themselves. I was probably going to pay a lot on the house,” Bailey replies. He’s sitting in his bed, where he’s made a canopy with a sheet to keep the light out, since the bright lights never turn off. Stacks of dollar bills lie atop his canopy, and he’s surrounded by 15 more briefcases filled with money, which he will only get if he can stick this out for another few months."

                description: "Founding a company during economic uncertainty and excelling takes more than just a hungry founder with a good idea. It requires a solid foundation to withstand the market. Companies founded today must focus on becoming profitable while growing, which is only sometimes a priority for companies receiving aggressive VC funding. In the pre-revenue stage, profitability has sometimes been top of mind, but keeping operations efficient and focused is vital for maximizing the potential for monetization. Investors are engaging with fewer pitch decks from founders, according to DocSend data — investor activity dropped less than 2% year-over-year (YoY) from 2022 and 4% from 2021. However, investors are still reviewing pitch decks at a higher clip than 2020, proving there’s a market for early-stage deals, even though funding was down 27% YoY in Q3."

                description: "It’s the season to go a little overboard on gift giving. But this year, give the gift of good security (and privacy) and eschew tech that can have untoward risks or repercussions. We’re not talking about things that go boom in the night or abruptly break, but rather the gifts that can have irreversible or ongoing consequences in the future. This year we’ve seen some of the biggest hacks involving healthcare and genetic data, a growing ubiquity of consumer surveillance tech snooping on unsuspecting everyone and ongoing unscrupulous data practices that sell your private information to anyone who wants to buy it. The best remedy for some of this is to never engage to begin with."

                description: "Product design is in a moment of profound change and redefinition as technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and spatial computing dramatically affect computing experiences. AI, especially, may have only minor impacts on interface design but will significantly impact the holistic product or ecosystem experience. Spatial computing, on the other hand, will change human-computer interactions and unmoor our understanding of what a computer is.In this innovation cycle, product design requires a wider perspective of platforms and interconnections between technologies, creating a strong need for technologists and designers to be in the process together."

                description: "There is no question that 2023 was a tough year for the venture and tech ecosystem. Carta revealed a dramatic decline in funding rounds and total investment, showing the total number of rounds in Q1 2023 dropping 64% and the total dollars invested dropping 86% from the peak in Q4 2021. Forum Ventures has seen firsthand how difficult the fundraising environment is for founders at all stages of this market, having invested in 100+ B2B SaaS companies this year across their accelerator and seed funds. Michael Cardamone, CEO and managing partner at Forum Ventures, spoke to emerging managers about the state of this market and reflected that “this is the hardest it has been to raise a fund in a long time. In a recent report, Forum Ventures surveyed 70 funds and analyzed data from 167 closed pre-seed and seed rounds between January and October 2023 to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the early-stage B2B SaaS investment landscape.”"
